The role of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in precision agriculture and smart
greenhouses has been reinforced by recent R&D projects, growing
commercialization of IoT infrastructure, and related technologies such as
satellites, artificial intellige nce, sensors, actuators, uncrewed aerial vehicles, big
data analytics, intelligent machines, and radio-frequency identification devices.
<h3>1. IoT Infrastructure</h3>
<h3>What would be a typical IoT infrastructure setup for our
    greenhouses?</h3>

    <li> Environment Check</li>
   <li>  Rain,athmosphere pressure,solar radiation,luminosity</li>
    <li> Heat Monitoring</li>
        <li>   Air Temperature,air humidity</li>
            <li>   Substrate Monitoring</li>
                <li>   Soil temperature,soil moisture,Ph,chemical elements</li>
                    <li>  Fertilizer and medicine system for plants growth and behaviour</li>
                        <li>   Lighthing settings for plants’ needs</li>
                            <li>  Gas Pressure Sensor</li>
                                <li>  Oxygen Sensor</li>
                                    <li>    Wind Speed Sensor</li>
    <h3>2. Constraints</h3>
<h3>What are some constraints we may be dealing with within our
    greenhouse operation?</h3>
    <li><h3>Common problem No. 1: Air filtration</h3></li>
    Typically, greenhouses are not sealed environments (such as hybrid
facilities with glass roofs), but rather forced air/positive pressure
environments. This means that they should be equipped with air filtration
and sterilization capabilities on both the intake air and the exhausted air.
The intake air is filtered and sterilized for pest and disease prevention. A
proper ventilation system also allows a grower to control vapor pressure
deficit (VPD) to some degree.
<li><h3>Common problem No. 2: Greenhouse temperature swings</h3></li>
With such extreme environmental temperatures, one possible recourse that
doesn’t require increasing air conditioning capacity is to use either shade
cloth or a greenhouse whitewash to control excessively hot environmental
conditions, both ambient temperatures as well as radiant temperature.
<li><h3>Common problem No. 3: Watering and fertigation systems</h3></li>
After harvest and in between crop cycles is the perfect time to troubleshoot
and repair/replace any and all worn out, broken or defective irrigation or
fertigation equipment.
Measure the flow rate to determine whether a fertigation system is
functioning properly. Ideally, growers will have a baseline that was first
measured after the system was installed against which to compare.
<li><h3>Common problem No. 4: Constant mold and pest problems</h3></li>
Besides the overall function of the watering/fertigation system, close attention to
disinfection is a major priority. Pythium and other vectors for disease can be
transmitted by contaminated irrigation equipment and/or contaminated water
<li><h3>Common problem No. 5: Crops drying out</h3></li>
If crops seem consistently dehydrated, inspect all related electronic controls
responsible for watering, timing and cycles for clogs or mechanical failures to
prevent possible over/under watering or not watering on time.
<li><h3>Common problem No. 6: EC/nutrient level spikes</h3></li>
If there are noticeable spikes in nutrient solution electrical conductivity (EC)
(which growers would notice in runoff testing) but levels are normal at the
solution source, consider examining the fertigation lines, as fertilizer salts may
have accumulated.
