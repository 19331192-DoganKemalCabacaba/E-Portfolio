<center><h1 style="color: red;">Why is it important to have a backup system in place that works
closely with cyber security framework?</h1></center>
The purpose of the backup is to create a copy of data that can be recovered in the event of a
primary data failure. Primary data failures can be the result of hardware or software failure, data
corruption, or a human-caused event, such as a malicious attack (virus or malware), or
accidental deletion of data.
<h3></h3>5 Steps For Creating a Backup Strategy
<h3></h3>1. Define your backup needs
When creating a backup strategy, consider the following factors to ensure your
company’s unique needs are covered:
 Risk
 Infrastructure
 Frequency
 Compliance
 Storage
<h3>2. Budget for your backup plan</h3>
Since not all backup services cost the same, develop a budget before committing to a
solution. By doing this, you can determine how much the company is willing to spend
on a backup solution and whether it will be a capital or operating expense.
<h3>3. Choose a data backup vendor</h3>
While it’s possible for your organization to implement a backup solution without
assistance, a third-party backup vendor can help ensure you implement it correctly and
effectively.
<h3>4. Implement your data backup plan</h3>
After choosing a backup platform, consider what role your company has to play in
implementing the strategy. Vendors take considerably different approaches to helping
new customers successfully adopt and deploy their solutions.
<h3>5. Test your data backup plan</h3>
Once you’ve outlined and defined a backup plan, you need to test it to verify that it
works. One way to do this would be to simulate a data loss (where data is deleted) and
a data corruption (where data is updated).
