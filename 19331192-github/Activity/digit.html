<center><h1> Digitalization</h1></center>
<h3> What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</h3>
A digital enterprise is an organization that uses technology as a competitive
advantage in its internal and external operations.
<p>As information technology (IT) has reshaped the infrastructure and operations of
enterprises, the digital enterprise evolved to represent businesses that have
completed a digital transformation or digitalization to embed digital solutions
across the enterprise.</p>
Examples include business processes, products and business models that
incorporate digital strategy and digital transformation to compete more
effectively in the market.
<h3>What are the cyber Security challenges?</h3>
<h4>Ransomware</h4>
Ransomware is another tactic used by hackers. The objective is to hold a
company’s data hostage until the affected user pays a specific dollar
amount, which can often be hefty. These attacks can use email to
penetrate a system, but can also be initiated by visiting an infected
website, clicking on an online ad with malicious code, or hackers
exploiting network vulnerabilities. Prevention requires a combination of
training employees to exercise judicious caution regarding the websites
they visit, and remaining diligent in identifying and fixing system
vulnerabilities
<h4>Cloud computing issues</h4>
The amount of valuable information that resides on multiple data sources
has grown exponentially from the early days of computing. The
opportunity for organizations of all sizes to have their data compromised
grows as the number of devices that store confidential data increases.
Cloud storage and the Internet of Things (IoT) have exposed new
vulnerabilities. Organizations and businesses must make security plans
that take new security threats into consideration, rather than only
protecting business computers and mobile devices.
<h4>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</h4>
The hallmark of these attacks is coordination. A cyber attacker floods the
system with a high number of simultaneous functions, such as a request to
a webpage. The goal is to overwhelm networks, systems, or devices. This
can ultimately expose vulnerabilities that cyber attackers can exploit. Like
other forms of cyber attacks, this method’s sophistication has increased as
technology has evolved, making it vital for organizations to be aware of
the latest innovations to protect against these types of cybersecurity
issues.
<h4>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)</h4>
In the hands of cyber criminals, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning can enable cyber attacks to become more sophisticated and
efficient. Both can “learn” which attack methods work and which do not,
making them valuable tools for criminals. Fortunately for savvy
cybersecurity professionals, AI and machine learning can also be
deployed to combat cyber attacks.
<h4>Crypto and blockchain attacks</h4>
The use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in business
continues to increase. According to a report by Allied Market Research,
the global cryptocurrency industry (hardware, software, platforms, and
services) is projected to reach nearly $5 billion by 2030. This digital form
of monetary exchange has become fertile ground for cyber attackers, as
the infrastructure needed to safeguard the information associated with
these assets has been slow to develop. Those looking to use blockchain in
their businesses should take great care to make sure their cybersecurity
strategies include protection for these emerging, evolving markets.
