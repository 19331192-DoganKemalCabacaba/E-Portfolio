<h1><strong><p><center>-SolarWinds -</center></p></strong></h1>
<h3>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; RECONNAISSANCE In early 2020, hackers secretly broke into Texas-based SolarWind&apos;s systems and added malicious code into the company&apos;s software system. The system, called &quot;Orion,&quot; is widely used by companies to manage IT resources. Solarwinds has 33,000 customers that use Orion, according to SEC documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; WEAPONIZATION Beginning as early as March of 2020, SolarWinds unwittingly sent out software updates to its customers that included the hacked code. The code created a backdoor to customer&apos;s information technology systems, which hackers then used to install even more malware that helped them spy on companies and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; DELIVERY The SolarWinds company sent a software update which contains malicious code dropped by hackers to their customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; EXPLOITATION When the customers of SolarWinds executed the update the code entered their systems immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; INSTALLATION Hackers install the malicious code to the software update. &bull; COMMAND AND CONTROL Attackers had gained control when the code got into the companies systems and their goal was learning confidential information about the companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVES Intruders accomplished their goals by infiltrating the company software and systems.</p>
