<h1><strong><p><center>WEEK 3 AND 4 (Lecture 3&4)</center></p></strong></h1>
In this week we made a deeper introduction to cyber security. We
processed how the malicious attacks work with the cyber kill chain model,
item by item.Then we learned about 2 other models which are STRIDE
and DREAD models then we go through the steps of those 3 models with
bunch of examples and ideas. We understood and learned the cyber kill
chain model better by learning about the SolarWinds cyber attack, which
had happened in the past and caused great damage to the attacked
company.
