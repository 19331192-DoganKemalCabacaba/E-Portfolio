<h1><strong><center>REFLECTIONS</center></strong></h1>
    <h1><strong><center> WEEK 1 AND 2 (Lecture 1&2)</center></strong></h1>
At this week we made an introduction to the topic "Cyber Security" and I
found this topic quite fun to learn about.We made some scanning
activities with our instructor Mr.Beran and these activities were so
informative yet challenging because some of the commands we didn't
know but we learned them in a short time and applied them.Also we’ve
learned and informed about our term project which is a E-portfolio
creation via GitHub website and started to fill our E-portfolios with our
activities that we’ve done in the class.
